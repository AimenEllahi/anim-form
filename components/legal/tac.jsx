              READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING WAIVING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT OR TO PURSUE CLAIMS IN A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY.
              All rights not expressly granted to you are reserved by Dndai.app and its licensors.
              Use of the Product is also subject to acceptance of Dndai.app's Privacy Policy available at https://www.dndai.app/privacy.
              Please read and review both this Agreement and the Privacy Policy before using this Product. If you do not agree with or wish to accept the terms of either this Agreement or the Privacy Policy then please do not use the Product. By using this Product or otherwise accepting this Agreement and the Privacy Policy, you agree to be bound by this Agreement and the Privacy Policy and represent you satisfy all of the eligibility requirements below.
            </p>
            <p>
              These BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER provisions apply to you if you are domiciled in and/or acquired and use the Product in the United States. In the United States, this Agreement is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) and federal arbitration law. These provisions may also apply to you if you are domiciled in and/or acquired and use the Product from outside the United States. See JURISDICTION AND APPLICABLE LAW below for details.
              To the fullest extent allowed by applicable law, you and Dndai.app agree to submit all Disputes between us to individual, binding arbitration pursuant to the provisions in this Section 4. A “Dispute” means any dispute, claim, or controversy (except those specifically exempted below) between you and Dndai.app that in any way relates to or arises from any aspect of our relationship, including, without limitation, your use or attempted use of the Product, all marketing related to the Product, all Services, Service Provided Content, and Virtual Currency, any licensed content, and all matters relating to or arising from this Agreement (including Dndai.app’s Privacy Policy and all other terms incorporated into this Agreement) or any other agreement between you and Dndai.app, including any disputes over the validity or enforceability of this agreement to arbitrate. A Dispute shall be subject to these BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER provisions regardless of whether it is based in contract, statute, regulation, ordinance, tort (including fraud, misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, or negligence), or any other legal or equitable theory. This includes claims or requests for relief that accrued before you entered into this Agreement. You understand that there is no judge or jury in arbitration and that court review of an arbitration award is limited.
            </p>
            <p>
              Initial Dispute Resolution: Dndai.app's Customer Support department is available at info@dndai.app to address any concerns you may have regarding the Product. Most concerns are quickly resolved in this manner to our customers' satisfaction. In an effort to accelerate resolution and reduce the cost of any Dispute between us, you and Dndai.app agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute informally for at least thirty (30) days before either party initiates any arbitration or court proceeding (the “Initial Dispute Resolution Period”). That period begins upon receipt of written notice from the party raising the Dispute. If Dndai.app has a Dispute with you, it will send notice of that Dispute to your billing address and email address you have provided to us. If you have a Dispute with Dndai.app, you must notify us in writing at the following email address: info@dndai.app, using the subject line “Initial Dispute Resolution Notice.” Your notice of Dispute must be individual to you and must include your name, the screen name and/or email address associated with your player account, and your residential address. The notice of Dispute also must describe the Dispute, explain the facts of the Dispute as you understand them, and tell Dndai.app what you want us to do to resolve the problem. The parties shall use their best efforts to settle any Dispute directly through consultation and good faith negotiations, and you agree that a notice of Dispute containing all of the information required above, followed by at least 30 days of good faith negotiation, are preconditions to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration. A notice of Dispute will not be valid, will not start the Initial Dispute Resolution Period, and will not allow you or Dndai.app later to initiate a lawsuit or arbitration, unless it contains all of the information required by this paragraph. If either of us commences an arbitration without having previously provided a valid and compliant notice of Dispute, you and Dndai.app agree that the applicable arbitration provider (or the arbitrator, if one has been appointed) must suspend the arbitration until the party that initiated it complies with the Initial Dispute Resolution Period. You and Dndai.app authorize the arbitration provider or the arbitrator to decide summarily whether the party that commenced an arbitration complied with the Initial Dispute Resolution Period requirement, relying solely on this Agreement and the notice of Dispute (if any) that you or Dndai.app provided before commencing arbitration.
            </p>
            <p>
              Binding Arbitration: If a Dispute cannot be resolved through negotiations during the Initial Dispute Resolution Period, then either party may initiate binding arbitration as the sole means to formally resolve the Dispute, unless an exception applies as stated below. Except in the event of a Mass Arbitration (as defined below), the arbitration will be administered by JAMS in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (the “JAMS Rules”) effective as of the date of the Notice of Dispute, which are available at the JAMS website, http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration, as modified by this Agreement. If, for any reason, JAMS is unable to provide the arbitration, then except as otherwise stated below, you may file your Dispute with any national arbitration company that handles consumer arbitrations following procedures that are substantially similar to the JAMS Rules.
            </p>
            <p>
              Arbitration hearings may be conducted by videoconference unless the arbitrator believes an in-person hearing is necessary. In such instances, the location of an arbitration hearing will be decided pursuant to the JAMS Rules. For residents outside the United States, arbitration shall be initiated in Los Angeles County, California, and you and Dndai.app agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any federal or state court in Los Angeles County, California, in order to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.
            </p>
            <p>
              The arbitrator will make a decision in writing but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party. The arbitrator must follow applicable law. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding on you and Dndai.app, and any award of the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
              The arbitrator shall determine the scope and enforceability of this arbitration agreement, including whether a Dispute is subject to arbitration. The arbitrator has authority to decide all issues of validity, enforceability or arbitrability, including, but not limited to, where a party raises as a defense to arbitration that the claims in question are exempted from the arbitration requirement or that any portion of this agreement is not enforceable.
              If a lawsuit filed in court includes claims or requests for relief that are arbitrable and claims or requests for relief that are not, you and Dndai.app agree that any non-arbitrable claims or requests for relief shall be stayed pending the completion of the arbitration of the arbitrable claims or requests for relief.
            </p>
            <p>
              Class Action Waiver: TO THE FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOU AND DNDAI.APP AGREE THAT EACH PARTY MAY BRING DISPUTES AGAINST THE OTHER PARTY ONLY IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION OR CLASS ARBITRATION, OR AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL. To the extent applicable law does not permit waiver of private attorney general claims, but permits them to be arbitrated, then such claims shall be resolved in arbitration. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity.
              If any provision in Section 4 of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable, that provision shall be severed with the remainder of this Agreement remaining in full force and effect. The foregoing shall not apply to the prohibition against class or collective actions as provided for above. This means that if the prohibition against class or collective actions is found to be unenforceable for any reason, the entire Section 4 of this Agreement (but only Section 4) shall be null and void.
            </p>
            <p>
              Exception - Litigation of Intellectual Property and Small Claims Court Claims: Notwithstanding the parties' decision to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may bring an action in state or federal court that only asserts claims for patent infringement or invalidity, copyright infringement, moral rights violations, trademark infringement, and/or trade secret misappropriation, but not, for clarity, claims related to the license granted to you for the Product under this Agreement. Such claims aresubject to the jurisdiction and applicable law provisions in Section 5.
            </p>
            <p>
              Either party may also seek relief in a small claims court for any individual disputes or claims within the scope of that court's jurisdiction. If an arbitration is filed, before the arbitrator is formally appointed either party can send written notice to the opposing party and the applicable arbitration provider that it wants the case decided by a small claims court, after which the arbitration provider may close the case.
            </p>
            <p>
              Exception – Mass Arbitration Before FedArb: Notwithstanding the parties’ decision to have arbitrations administered by JAMS, if 20 or more demands for arbitration are filed relating to the same or similar subject matter and sharing common issues of law or fact, and counsel for the parties submitting the demands are the same or coordinated, you and we agree that this will constitute a “Mass Arbitration.” If a Mass Arbitration is commenced, you and we agree that it shall not be governed by JAMS Rules or administered by JAMS. Instead, a Mass Arbitration shall be administered by FedArb, a nationally recognized arbitration provider, and governed by the FedArb Rules in effect when the Mass Arbitration is filed, excluding any rules that permit arbitration on a class-wide basis (the “FedArb Rules”), and under the rules set forth in this Agreement. The FedArb Rules are available at https://www.fedarb.com/ or by calling 1-650-328-9500. You and we agree that the Mass Arbitration shall be resolved using FedArb’s Framework for Mass Arbitration Proceedings ADR-MDL, available at https://www.fedarb.com/. Before any Mass Arbitration is filed with FedArb, you and we agree to contact FedArb jointly to advise that the parties intend to use FedArb’s Framework for Mass Arbitration Proceedings ADR-MDL. The individual demands comprising the Mass Arbitration shall be submitted on FedArb’s claim form(s) and as directed by FedArb. You and Dndai.app agree that if either party fails or refuses to commence the Mass Arbitration before FedArb rather than JAMS, you or Dndai.app may seek an order from JAMS compelling compliance and directing administration of the Mass Arbitration before FedArb. Pending resolution of any such requests, you and we agree that all arbitrations comprising the Mass Arbitration (and any obligation to pay arbitration fees) shall be stayed.
            </p>
            <p>
              30 Day Right to Opt Out: You have the right to opt-out and not be bound by the arbitration agreement and class action waiver provisions in this Section 4 by sending written notice of your decision to opt-out to the following email address: info@dndai.app, using the subject line “Arbitration Opt-Out.” The notice must be sent within 30 days of purchasing the Product (or if no purchase was made, then within 30 days of the date on which you first access or use the Product and agree to these terms); otherwise you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of this Section 4. If you opt-out of these arbitration provisions, Dndai.app also will not be bound by them.

If any court or arbitrator determines that the "Class Action Waiver" paragraph set forth above is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then any and all claims arising out of this Agreement (including interpretation, claims for breach, and all other claims or requests for relief (including consumer protection, unfair competition, and tort claims)) shall be decided under the laws of the state where you were a citizen at the time you obtained or bought the Product that was subject to this Agreement. In addition, you and we irrevocably consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of state or federal courts in Los Angeles County, California to resolve any claims or requests for relief that are subject to exceptions to the arbitration agreement described in BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER above, or otherwise determined not to be arbitrable. Nothing in this paragraph shall preclude you or Dndai.app from removing to federal court a case originally filed in state court, if federal court jurisdiction exists. To the fullest extent permitted by law, any claim or request for relief in a demand for arbitration filed pursuant to Section 4 of this Agreement, as well as any claim or request for relief in a lawsuit filed in court under an exception to the arbitration agreement in Section 4, shall be barred if filed more than two (2) years after the date that the claim or request for relief accrued.

              You agree that you will be responsible for all uses of the account by your child whether or not such uses were authorized by you.
              If you are a registered user of social media sites you may be able to connect your social media account and your Dndai.app account (if your applicable Dndai.app account has this functionality enabled). Your social media accounts are subject to their own Third Party Terms. You acknowledge and agree that your social media account provider is not responsible for your Dndai.app account, including for any liability connected to your use of your Dndai.app account, and that irrespective of whether you use an anonymous gamer tag or username, once you connect your Dndai.app account to your social media account, your real name will be available and viewable by your social media "friends". Please also see Dndai.app's Privacy Policy available at https://www.dndai.app/privacy for additional information on social networks.
              Depending on which Product and platform or Device you are using, your username on the platform may be your username in the Dndai.app account. Additionally, some Dndai.app accounts may allow users to form different "clans", "squads", "teams", or other groups (collectively "groups") with unique group names. When you choose a username or a group name, or otherwise create a label that can be seen by other users, you must abide by the following guidelines as well as the rules of common decency. If Dndai.app finds such a nameto be offensive or improper, it may, in its sole and absolute discretion, change or remove the name, and/or suspend or terminate your use of the service and, if you are a resident outside North America, apply additional consequences set out in Section 14(B)(ii). In particular, you may not use any name:
              <ul>
                <li>Belonging to another person with the intent to impersonate that person, including without limitation any Product administrators or any other employee or agent of Dndai.app;</li>
                <li>That incorporates vulgar language or which is otherwise offensive, defamatory, obscene, hateful, or racially, sexually, ethnically or otherwise objectionable;</li>
                <li>Belonging to any religious figure or deity;</li>
                <li>Related to drugs, sex, alcohol, or criminal activity;</li>
                <li>That is subject to the rights of any other person or entity without written authorization from that person or entity;</li>
                <li>That belongs or refers to a popular culture figure, celebrity, media personality, icon or persona;</li>

              </ul>
              You may not use a misspelling or an alternative spelling to circumvent the name restrictions listed above, nor can you have a "first" and "last" name that, when combined, violate the above name restrictions.
            </p>
            <p>
              To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you are responsible for all use of your account. You must notify Dndai.app immediately of any unauthorized use of your username, password, account information, or any other breach of security that you become aware of relating to your Account. Such notification should be made via the Customer Support web page.

            <p>
            From time to time, Dndai.app may need to amend this Agreement if there is a good reason for the change and the changes reasonably take into account the interests of both parties, for example to reflect or include new products or services, and to enhance security for users or because of changes in the law, but we will not modify the terms to change our main obligations to you. If Dndai.app makes a change to this Agreement, we will inform you of the particular changes in advance of the changes coming into force, and you will have at least six weeks (starting from our notice to you) to indicate whether you accept the amended Agreement. If you don’t tell us that you object to the changes within the time period set out above, you shall be deemed to have accepted these changes (i) unless you have notified us of your objection to such changes within the stated six weeks, or (ii) if you use the Product after the changes have entered into force. In the notification, we will inform you of your right to object, the applicable notice period and the legal consequences of a failure to object.

The latest version of this Agreement will always be available on our website, so we recommend that you check for updates to this Agreement each time you use the Product. Changes to the Agreement shall not affect your accrued rights, shall not substantially disrupt the contractual balance between you and us under this Agreement and shall not have retroactive effect.
