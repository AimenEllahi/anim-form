              dndai.app uses cookies, advertising IDs and/or similar technologies on the Properties (collectively referred to as "Cookies"). A "Cookie" is a small bit of record-keeping information that many websites and other online products and services often store on a user's computer or device in order to identify it and associate activity with it. Cookies make the interaction between you and the website faster and easier by letting you navigate between pages efficiently, storing your preferences, and generally improving your experience of a website. For example, we use Cookies when you login to your dndai.app account to keep you logged in so that every time you move to a new page on our website you do not have to reenter your login details. On mobile, we use your mobile device advertising ID. Advertising IDs are non-permanent, non-personal identifiers such as the Android advertising ID and/or Apple's ID for advertising (the ‘IDFA’), which are uniquely associated with your mobile device.
