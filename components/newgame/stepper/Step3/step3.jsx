              The players are approached by a mysterious figure cloaked in
              shadows during a bustling festival in a small town. The figure
              reveals that they possess an ancient map leading to the lost
              capital of Althar, where the Heart of Echoes is said to lie.
              <br />
              The figure's dying words, as they collapse from a poisoned wound,
              are a cryptic warning: "Beware the echoes... they are not what
              they seem." As the players investigate the figure's death and the
              map's authenticity, they are drawn into a race against time.
              <br />
              Other groups are also on the hunt for the Heart of Echoes, and
              dark forces conspire to use its power for their own ends. The
              players must unravel the mystery before the artifact falls into
              the wrong hands and brings about a new age of darkness.
