              be able to access or use our Properties. Limit Use of Your

              to limit our use of their sensitive personal information if we use
              such personal information to infer characteristics about them. We
              do not currently use sensitive personal information for such
              purposes. In some states, we may be required to obtain your
              consent before collecting your sensitive personal information.
              Sale and Sharing of Personal Information; Targeted Advertising
              Under the laws of some states, consumers have the right to opt out
              of the sale of personal information or the sharing of their
              personal information with third parties for targeted advertising
              (also known as cross-context behavioral advertising or
              interest-based advertising). In applicable states, Dndai.app
              automatically opts out any users who it knows to be between the
              ages of 13 and 15 from receiving targeted advertising. We share
              certain information with third parties who do work on our behalf
              for the business purposes we describe above. We also may allow
              third-party advertising companies to collect Information about
              your activity on our websites and in our apps, for example through
              cookies, mobile ad identifiers, pixels, web beacons and social
              network plugins. These advertising entities use Information they
              collect to help us provide more relevant advertisements and for
              other purposes described in our Privacy Policy. You can control
              the sharing of your personal information for targeted advertising
              through our websites and apps in the following ways: To set up
              cookie controls and opt-out of advertising cookies, ..Including
              third-party advertising cookies, by clicking here. You can also
              set up cookie controls through many browser settings and you can
              use industry-wide opt outs to control the use of cookies for
              interest-based advertising purposes. You may also opt out through
              the settings page of Dndai.app mobile applications that may share
              your data for these purposes. You can find additional information
              in the Mobile Advertising section above and in our Cookie Policy.
              The personal information collected through these methods is
              associated with your browser or device, so if you would like to
              opt out for this information you will need to disable cookies or
              trackers as described above. Because your opt-out preference is
              stored in a cookie, if you reset your advertising ID or clear your
              cookies then we will not recognize your device or your choices, so
              you must opt out again. You may also disable non-advertising
              cookies through your browser or device settings. In applicable
              states, where required, Dndai.app recognizes Do Not Track settings
              and the Global Privacy Control. Personal Information Collected
              Through Dndai.app Accounts: In addition to the opt-outs related to
              advertising above, we support the applicable state laws by
              allowing residents to opt out of the sale or sharing of their
              personal information for targeted advertising by clicking here.
              Logging in with an account helps us to process your request. You
              can also submit a request to opt out of sales or sharing by
              emailing us at info@dndai.app.

              How to Exercise Your Access, Correction, and Deletion Rights
            </h3>
            <p>
              You may exercise any privacy rights to which you are entitled by
              submitting your request to us here or sending an email to
              info@dndai.app. To exercise your right to correction, please
              update your account information directly or send an email to
              info@dndai.app. For security purposes, we will verify your
              identity – and may request information from you to do so – when
              you request to exercise your privacy rights. If you have an online
              account you use to interact with Dndai.app, logging into your
              account will serve to verify your identity and request. We may
              request additional information if we believe your account has been
              compromised. If you do not have an account with us, or if we have
              reason to suspect that the security of your account is
              compromised, then we may request additional information from you
              to match with our existing records to verify your identity,
              depending on the nature of the request and the sensitivity of the
              information sought. Some states permit you to designate an agent
              to make requests to exercise your rights as described above. We
              will take steps to both verify the identity of the person seeking
              to exercise their rights as listed above, and to verify that your
              agent has been authorized to make a request on your behalf through
              providing us with a signed written authorization or a copy of a
              power of attorney. Once we have verified your identity (and your
              authorized agent, as applicable), we will respond to your request
              as appropriate. If we are unable to complete your requests, we
              will provide you information about the reasons that we could not
              comply with your request, as required by applicable law.
